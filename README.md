This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in R related to subsetting data frames using character vectors.  The issue arises from R's partial matching behavior when column names aren't precisely specified. The `bug.R` file contains code that showcases this behavior. The `bugSolution.R` file provides a corrected version that addresses the problem and explains best practices for avoiding this type of error.
